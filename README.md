# Precalculus-through-Data-and-Modelling-Specialization
Learn foundational math skills and concepts. Develop the mathematical skills you need to analyze, visualize, and model data.


# WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
- Model data with both single and multivariable functions
- Visualize and analyze data using different technologies.
- Understand properties of different types of functions to apply them accordingly to model different situations.
- Perform vector operations, such as addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product, to analyze geometry in space.

SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN
- function analysis
- vectors
- regression
- Data Analysis
- Modelling

# About this Specialization
This specializations helps to build the foundational material to use mathematics as a tool to model, understand, and interpret the world around us. This is done through studying functions, their properties, and applications to data analysis. Concepts of precalculus provide the set of tools for the learner to begin their scientific career, preparing them for future science and calculus courses. This specialization is designed for all learners, not just those interested in further mathematics courses. Those interested in the natural sciences, computer sciences, psychology, sociology, or similar will genuinely benefit from this introductory course, applying the skills learned to their discipline to analyze and interpret their subject material.

Learners will be presented with not only new ideas, but also new applications of an old subject. Real-life data, exercise sets, and regular assessments help to motivate and reinforce the content in this course, leading to learning and mastery.

# Applied Learning Project
In each module, learners will be provided with solved sample problems that they can use to build their skills and confidence followed by graded quizzes to demonstrate what they've learned. Finally, each course in the specialization concludes with a final exam that learners can use to demonstrate their mastery of the material.
