# Precalculus: Relations and Functions

# About this Course
This course helps to build the foundational material to use mathematics as a tool to model, understand, and interpret the world around us.  This is done through studying functions, their properties, and applications to data analysis.  Concepts of precalculus provide the set of tools for the beginning student to begin their scientific career, preparing them for future science and calculus courses. This course is designed for all students, not just those interested in further mathematics courses.  

Students interested in the natural sciences, computer sciences, psychology, sociology, or similar will genuinely benefit from this introductory course, applying the skills learned to their discipline to analyze and interpret their subject material.  Students will be presented with not only new ideas, but also new applications of an old subject. Real-life data, exercise sets, and regular assessments help to motivate and reinforce the content in this course, leading to learning and mastery.

# WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
* Model data with both single and multivariable functions
* Visualize and analyze data using different technologies.
* Understand properties of different types of functions to apply them accordingly to model different situations.
* Perform vector operations, such as addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product, to analyze geometry in space.
